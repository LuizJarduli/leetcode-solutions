# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). Each solution is organized by category and includes detailed explanations, complexity analysis, and implementations in multiple programming languages.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```sh
leet-code-solutions/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ arrays/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...solutions
â”œâ”€â”€ strings/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...solutions
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

Each subdirectory contains:

- **`solution.*`:** The implementation of the solution in a specific programming language.
- **`README.md`:** A description of the problem, complexity analysis, and the approach used.

## Categories

The problems are divided into the following categories:

1. **Arrays**: Solutions related to array operations and manipulations.
2. **Strings**: Problems involving string parsing, pattern matching, and transformations.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Problems solved using dynamic programming techniques.
4. **Graphs**: Graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms.
